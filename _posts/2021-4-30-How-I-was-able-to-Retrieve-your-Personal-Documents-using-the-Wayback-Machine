title: How I was able to Retrieve your Personal Documents using the Wayback Machine!
---


Hi guys, I am back with another blog. It has been a long time since I released anything, so here I am. This one was a really interesting vulnerability and it was pretty fun to exploit it. Without wasting any more of your time, lets get into the bug :)

**Summary**


Lets call the target website as **shortener-example.com** to respect the privacy of the company. Let me brief you about the website's main feature. The Main website of the company was **www.example.com** and the domain I found this vulnerability on(shortener-example.com) was the company's custom URL shortener.
The `shortener-example.com` domain was responsible for shortening all the links sent by users of the application to each other in private chat on `www.example.com`. Due to a misconfiguration in the way this was implemented, I was able to retrieve the personal documents that a user would send to another user in personal chats.
